	<h2><span class="esports">What is an eSport?</span></h2>
		<p>
			The answer to that question is actually pretty simple. An eSport is essentially just a multiplayer game being played competitively for spectators to watch. 
			There are many different types or "genres" of eSports which we'll talk more about in the <a href="examples.html">Genres </a> section. A basic summary for now is that
			these different genres can be thought of in a similar way to traditional sports and how they all have their own different rulesets and ways to play/win the game.
		</p>
		<h3><span class="esports">Why watch someone play video games?</span></h3>
		<p> 
			For some people who are new to all of this, it may seem like 
			there's no way that watching people play video games could be entertaining. To those people I would say to think of it like this, when talking about video games some 
			people may say "Why not just play the games yourself? Why watch someone else?" which I would then compare to sports. Why watch people play basketball when you could just 
			play basketball yourself? You watch sports because you get to watch the best of the best compete, you find a team that you like which may be the team from your city or state, 
			or just a team that has players that you like to watch play. The exact same can be said for eSports. Just like sports, tons of games can be played by everyone, but it 
			takes a ton of time, dedication, and practice to become the best of the best. And depending on the game and the genre, it can be super exciting to watch the best compete.
		</p>
		<h3><span class="esports">Who are they for?</span></h3>
		<p>
			If you haven't really gotten into gaming yourself, the concept may seem silly. But if you've got that "competitive drive" and have a game you like, you may actually 
			be able to find an eSport you really enjoy. If you've ever played a multiplayer game, and I'll use some of the most popular multipalyer games in recent years such as 
			"Fortnite" or "Call of Duty", you'll know that being the last person alive in Fortnite and seeing the "#1 Victory" screen can be an extremely satisfying and fun experience.
			Or having the most kills and being at the top of the leaderboard at the end of a match in Call of Duty.
		<br>
		<h3><span class="esports">How can video games be competitive?</span></h3>
		<p>
			Many games nowadays take that feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction of winning to the next level and implement what is knowned as a "Ranked" system into their games. 
			This generally means that there will be a separate section in the multiplayer part of a game in which you earn "rating" 
			when you win a match, and lose rating when you lose a match. Each game will have their own method or way to measure that rating, but then that rating is then used to measure 
			you against other players, in order to match you with people of similar ratings. Many games will have rewards for getting a higher rating, whether it be in game rewards, or even 
			in some cases, real world and even cash prizes.
		</p>
		<h3><span class="esports">So how do I compete?</span></h3>
		<p>
			That's a bit of a trickier answer, which we'll dive into a bit deeper in the <a href="gettinginvolved.html">Getting Involved </a> section.
