	<h2><span class="esports">How to Get Involved</span></h2>
	<p>
		Getting involved in eSports can mean several different things so we'll break this up into several different sections.
	</p>
	<h3><span class="esports">Becoming a Player</span></h3>
		<p>
			I'll start off by saying that if you are interested in becoming a player, that's awesome! Though, not to be discouraging, but it's worth mentioning that it's an extremely difficult 
			process, and like with traditional sports, not everyone makes it. Becoming the best of the best takes a ton of time and effort, just like with traditional sports 
			you have to dedicate a huge amount of your free time to playing, practicing, and becoming the best regardless of which game you choose. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The path to finding yourself at the top competing with the best on a stage in front of thousands is also unfortunately not super simple. In most cases the simplest and 
			clearest path remains the same no matter which game you are playing. Spending a ton of time playing the game and playing the ranked system within that game, and 
			grinding your way to the top. Now for some games and for some people, this is enough to get noticed by organizations, which will then contact the player and sign them 
			to their roster to compete at the highest level.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			For others, it'll take a bit more effort. This in most cases meaning finding lower level tournaments that are ran by the community of that game, competing in those 
			tournaments and winning. These tournaments can be online, or hosted somewhere that you'd need to travel to, again depending on the game and community. Playing in tons 
			of tournaments and performing well, will in most cases result in cash prizes, but will also tend to get you noticed by organizations or other professional players.
		</p>
		<h3><span class="esports">Watching eSports</span></h3>
		<p>
			If you are finding yourself interested in the concept of eSports and want to know how to watch, the answer is a little bit complicated. 
			With eSports being a relatively new phenomenon there isn't a totally centralized network or platform to watch whatever you like, so you have to do a small bit of searching. 
			If you know which game you want to watch, the easiest way to find out when and where tournaments are being livestreamed would be to find the social media pages of either 
			the game itself, or the company that created the game. If you don't have a specific game in mind, the most popular platforms to watch eSports are Amazon's 
			<a href="http://twitch.tv">Twitch </a>which is a hub for not just eSports but a space for anyone to livestream. They have a very easy to navigate directory section, which 
			lists each different game being streamed as it's own category. There is also the gaming section of <a href="http://youtube.com">Youtube</a>.
		</p>
		<h3><span class="esports">Careers in the Industry</span></h3>
		<p>
			This question will be answered a bit more in depth in the <a href="related.html">Related Paths </a> section.
