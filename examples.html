	<h2><span class="esports">Types of eSports</span></h2>
	<p>
		There are tons and tons of different genres of games, way more than I could have time to get into here, but for the most part there's a select few that are currently 
		the most popular in eSports. We'll go over them one by one.
	</p>
	<h3><span class="esports">First Person Shooters</span></h3>
	<p>
		One of the most accessible, popular, and easy to understand genres currently is the First Person Shooter (FPS) genre. 
		FPS games are simply games which are in the First Person perspective as in it looks as if you are in the in game character's head looking through their eyes, as said in the name 
		the core gameplay revolves around fighting enemies, with weapons normally depicted as real world guns or at least very similar to them, and in the case of eSports those enemies 
		are other players within that game. FPS games can vary drastically, and even have their own subgenres. However, in context of eSports the games generally remain relatively similar to each other. 
		The majority (though there are exceptions) of FPS eSports involve a 5 player versus 5 player game in which there is normally an objective in which the teams fight over. The games 
		are generally round based, and a team wins by either completing the objective, or eliminating the enemy team. One of the most popular games in this category is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, 
		the video below explains the game in detail:

	<h3><span class="esports">Battle Royales</span></h3>
	<p>
		Battle Royales are among the most popular, and actually a very simple genre to understand, but can vary pretty heavily in gameplay. The easiest way to understand them is to think of it like 
		Suzanne Collins' "The Hunger Games". A number of players (generally around 50-100) are placed into a large map with all of the other players, and have to loot weapons and 
		supplies to then fight the other players. For most battle royales there is a game mechanic that makes the map smaller and smaller, forcing the players closer and closer to 
		each other, which results in them fighting, and ultimately one player being the last man standing as the winner. These can be very exciting to watch because of the large 
		amount of players involved. Anyone can win!

	<h3><span class="esports">MOBAs</span></h3>
		<p>
		MOBAs or Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas are an extremely popular, but much less accessible or easy to understand from the outside genre. These can also vary heavily, 
		but generally the most MOBAs are games where you play with a birds eye perspective, think like a chess player looking at a chess board, and the objective is to destroy the 
		enemy team's base. The vast majority of MOBAs are 5v5, where the players complete objectives to earn in game currency which they use to make their character stronger. 
		Each player on the team plays a different character which each have their own set of abilities. Each team is trying to defend their own base, while also pushing forward to 
		attack the enemy base. Whichever teams base is destroyed first, loses the game.
