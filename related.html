	<h2><span class="esports">Other Paths within the Gaming Industry</span></h2>
	<p>
		There's a ton of different opportunities within the industry, other than just playing or being a spectator. Whether you're looking for a fun hobby, or a career path, there's 
		something for everyone!
	</p>
	<h3><span class="esports">Careers</span></h3>
	<p>
		The gaming industry is currently a massive, multibillion dollar industry. There are tons of opportunities to work in the industry opening all of the time. 
		If you're someone that loves games and would love to work in an environment around them, there are tons of studios hiring people whether it be, software engineers, PR specialists, 
		community managers, etc. With how large the industry has become, some of these companies have become so large, that regardless of your skills or education, there may be 
		a job for you. As someone who is also looking to work in this industry, I've found an awesome resource recently called <a href=http://hitmarker.net>Hitmarker</a>. This is 
		a free to use website specifically catered towards jobs within the gaming industry. Tons of the largest companies in the industry post jobs every day.
	</p>
	<h3><span class="esports">Content Creator</span></h3>
	<p>
		Something that has become absolutely massive within the gaming industry recently is content creation. One form of content creation that has become extremely popular within the last several years 
		is livestreaming. The two largest platforms for doing so are Twitch and YouTube which I've mentioned earlier. The concept may be somewhat confusing for people who aren't familiar, 
		but essentially a streamer will just broadcast themselves on whichever platform they choose, generally while playing video games but it doesn't have to be just gaming related. 
		Then people on the website can then find their page and interact with the streamer through a text chat box.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		This can be just a fun hobby for someone who wants to interact with 
		other people while gaming, or like some of the largest streamers have done, you can build a community of people who enjoy watching you, with methods to monetize your stream! 
		Most of these platforms provide a subscription service for people to pay a fee to subscribe to their favorite streamers, which the streamer then gets a cut of that subscription. 
		This has become an absolutely massive industry in the last several years, with some of the top streamers making millions and millions of dollars, simply for being either 
		entertaining, or very good at a video game. And anyone can create an account for free and start streaming at any time!
